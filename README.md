# Rust Playground 🚀

Welcome to my Rust Playground! 🌱🎮 This is where I experiment with Rust, learn new concepts, and build small projects to practice my Rust skills. 

## About This Repository

This is a collection of mini Rust projects and exercises that help me get comfortable with the basics of Rust programming. Whether you're here to learn or just want to see some cool code snippets, this is the place to explore!

## Projects 🛠️

- **hello_cargo**: A simple "Hello, World!" project to get familiar with Rust syntax, variables, and basic structure.
- **guessing_game**: A fun little CLI game where you guess a randomly generated number. This project introduces handling user input and using Rust's `rand` crate.
